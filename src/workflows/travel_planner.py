"""
Travel Planner Workflow
=======================
Sequential orchestration: Researcher → WeatherAnalyst → Planner.

Uses MAF's SequentialBuilder for high-level workflow construction.
The shared conversation context (list[Message]) flows through each participant,
with each agent appending its response to the chain.

Architecture:
    User Query
        → Researcher (LLM-only: destination research)
        → WeatherAnalyst (MCP tools: weather, time, restaurants)
        → Planner (LLM-only: synthesize into travel plan)
        → Final Output
